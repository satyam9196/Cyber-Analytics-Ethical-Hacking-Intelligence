## 📊 Dashboard Features

### 1️⃣ Threat Detection Overview
- Monthly cyber attack analysis
- Comparison of total attacks vs blocked attacks
- Helps identify attack growth trends

### 2️⃣ Vulnerability Severity Analysis
- Categorizes vulnerabilities into:
  - Critical
  - High
  - Medium
  - Low
- Helps prioritize vulnerability remediation

### 3️⃣ ML Model Performance Evaluation
- Compared multiple ML models:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - Neural Network
